# Competition - Morgan Stanley's Quant Challange
Morgan Stanley's Quant Challenge Qualifier Competition

## About the competition
Morgan Stanley’s Quant Challenge is a chance to experience first-hand how quantitative analytics teams work within a global investment bank.
Use your skills in data analysis, modelling and model-testing to solve complex problems, inspired by real challenges our Firm’s analysts tackle every day.

## Description of the Challenge
How would you forecast the effects of climate change on agricultural businesses? Help an imaginary bank find an innovative solution to support its clients in the agriculture sector.
In the qualification round, you’ll be required to use your analytical and programming skills to build a model that estimates future crop yields as a function of weather, based on historical data. The teams with the best models will progress to the final where they will be tasked with handling the risk associated with climate change based on two potential weather scenarios.

## Participants
The Quant Challenge is an exciting opportunity for thoughtful, analytical problem-solvers to gain hands-on experience. Active students and recent graduates experienced in economics, mathematics and physics are all welcome and encouraged to register. To participate in the Technical Challenge, participants will also need programming and data analysis skills.
